our watch shouldn’t cost more than your car. It should look 
and feel like a power tool and not a piece of bling. Wearing 
it shouldn’t make you think twice about swinging a hammer or 
changing a tire. A timepiece should be ready for anything. But that’s 
just my opinion. If you agree, maybe you’re ready for the Stauer 
Centurion Hybrid. Use your Exclusive Insider Promotional Code

This watch doesn’t do dainty. And neither do I. I want my boots 
to be leather, my tires to be deep-tread monsters, and my steak 
thick and rare. Inspiration for a watch should come from things 
like fast cars, firefighters and power tools. And if you want to 
talk beauty, then let’s discuss a 428 cubic inch V8.
